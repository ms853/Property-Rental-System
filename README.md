# Property-Rental-System
This project is actually one of my academic assignments I had to complete for my Advance Web Technologies module, during my first semester of my masters degree. 

## About the project
The aim of the project, is to design property rental system for a rental company. All property records should have an address, maximum number of occupancy etc. 
The server side of the application consisted of developing a WCF service which offers operations to: Search for a property by postcode, Enter a new property into the database and Get a list of available student lettings. 
The database for the application was MySQL with respect two tables properties and lettings. 
Lastly, I implemented the client side of the application to invoke the WCF services which I implemented on the server. 

This solution of mine received a mark of Distinction.
